            <p>Hope and change. With those words, eight years ago, America ushered in a remarkable period in our history. Barack Obama, a black man, won the presidency in a country where slavery and racism were incorporated into the nation’s Constitution and social fabric. That a man of mixed race and mixed religion who grew up in a single-parent household could be elected, re-elected, and serve ably and honorably, reflects greatness not only in the individual, but in a society that has come a very long way.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Obamas Dream,</strong> We have had disagreements with President Obama’s policies and politics. But upon reflection: he comported himself beyond reproach. There was never a hint of personal scandal. As a role model–as a father, as a man, as the elected head-of-state–he acted with conviction, with honesty, with compassion, and with intelligence. (How can you not admire a man who invites his mother-in-law to live him for eight years?) </p>
